# Example for a user configuration file ~/.msmtprc

# With modern mail services that publish autoconfiguration information,
# you can simply run 'msmtp --configure yourmail@example.com' to get
# a basic working configuration.

# This example focusses on TLS and authentication. Features not used here
# include logging, timeouts, SOCKS proxies, TLS parameters, Delivery Status
# Notification (DSN) settings, and more.

# Set default values: use the mail submission port 587, and always use TLS.
# On this port, TLS is activated via STARTTLS.
